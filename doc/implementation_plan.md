# Implementation Plan: ML Surrogate for DFT Energies/Forces with UQ & Misspecification Detection

## 1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing
- Select datasets (MP, OQMD, NOMAD, AFLOW) based on coverage, quality, and relevance.
- Download and organize data (energies, forces, structures, metadata).
- Clean data: remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize units.
- Feature engineering: generate descriptors (e.g., atomistic, graph-based, chemical features).
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.

## 2. Model Selection & Training
- Choose ML models suitable for surrogate DFT prediction:
  - Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for built-in UQ
  - Neural Networks (NN), e.g., Graph Neural Networks (GNN), SchNet, ALIGNN
  - Ensemble methods (Random Forests, Deep Ensembles)
- Train models on DFT data to predict energies/forces.
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for robust performance.

## 3. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)
- Integrate UQ methods:
  - Bayesian approaches (GPR, Bayesian NNs)
  - Deep Ensembles (variance-based UQ)
  - Monte Carlo Dropout (NNs)
- Calibrate uncertainty estimates using reliability diagrams, scoring rules, and test set evaluation.
- Document UQ metrics (confidence intervals, coverage probability, calibration error).

## 4. Misspecification Detection & Fallback Triggers
- Implement out-of-distribution (OOD) detection:
  - Use UQ scores to flag high-uncertainty predictions
  - Apply OOD detection algorithms (e.g., Mahalanobis distance, density estimation)
- Design fallback triggers:
  - If uncertainty exceeds threshold, revert to DFT or flag for manual review
  - Log and analyze misspecification cases for model improvement

## 5. Evaluation & Benchmarking
- Compare surrogate predictions to ground-truth DFT results (energies, forces).
- Assess UQ calibration, OOD detection, and fallback effectiveness.
- Benchmark against published surrogates and UQ methods.

## 6. Documentation & Reproducibility
- Document all steps, code, and data sources.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) and notebooks for reproducibility.
- Prepare summary tables, plots, and reports for each stage.

## 7. Quantum Computing Connection
- Highlight transferable skills: ML, UQ, OOD detection, data engineering.
- Note how surrogate modeling and UQ methods apply to quantum simulation workflows.
- Plan for future integration of quantum ML models and quantum datasets.
- Explore quantum algorithms for materials modeling (e.g., VQE, QAOA, quantum kernel methods).
- Investigate hybrid quantum-classical ML approaches (e.g., quantum neural networks, quantum graph neural networks).
- Identify quantum-ready datasets and platforms (IBM Quantum, Google Quantum AI, Xanadu, etc.).
- Develop skills in quantum programming languages (Qiskit, PennyLane, Cirq) and quantum ML libraries.
- Connect with quantum computing research communities and stay updated on advances in quantum materials science.
- Document how each project step builds a foundation for quantum computing research and applications.

## Timeline & Milestones
- Week 1: Data acquisition, cleaning, feature engineering
- Week 2: Model selection, initial training, UQ integration
- Week 3: Misspecification detection, fallback triggers, evaluation
- Week 4: Benchmarking, documentation, quantum computing connection
