## 1. Bayesian Prior Construction for Uncertainty Quantification in First-Principles Statistical Mechanics (arXiv:2509.07326)

### Main Contribution
This paper introduces a Bayesian framework for constructing priors to quantify uncertainty in first-principles statistical mechanics, with a particular focus on models based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). The authors address the challenge of propagating uncertainty from quantum mechanical calculations through to macroscopic thermodynamic and kinetic properties, which is crucial for reliable predictions in materials science and chemistry.

### Techniques
The approach leverages hierarchical Bayesian modeling, allowing for the systematic incorporation of uncertainty at multiple levels of the modeling process. The framework starts with uncertainty in DFT-calculated energies and propagates these uncertainties through statistical mechanics workflows, such as Monte Carlo simulations and molecular dynamics. The authors discuss methods for prior selection, model calibration, and posterior inference, providing a comprehensive toolkit for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in first-principles modeling.

Key techniques include:
- Hierarchical Bayesian models for multi-level uncertainty propagation
- Prior construction based on physical intuition and empirical data
- Posterior inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational methods
- Calibration of surrogate models to match DFT outputs

### Findings
The paper demonstrates that Bayesian priors can be tailored to reflect both physical knowledge and empirical observations, leading to more reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimates. The authors show that their framework improves the robustness of predictions for thermodynamic properties, such as free energies and phase diagrams, by accounting for uncertainty in the underlying quantum mechanical calculations.

### Relevance to Project
This work is directly applicable to the development of ML surrogates for DFT, as it provides a principled approach to UQ that can be integrated into surrogate modeling pipelines. The Bayesian framework ensures that uncertainty is properly quantified and propagated, which is essential for calibrated UQ and misspecification detection. The methods outlined in this paper can be adapted to ML models, enabling the development of surrogates with reliable uncertainty estimatesâ€”a key deliverable for your project.

### Implications for Quantum Computing
The hierarchical Bayesian approach is foundational for future work in quantum computing, where uncertainty quantification will be critical for interpreting results from quantum simulations. As quantum computing becomes more prevalent in materials science, the ability to rigorously quantify and propagate uncertainty will be increasingly important.
