# ML Surrogate Modeling for DFT with UQ, Misspecification Detection, and Quantum Computing

This repository contains a reproducible pipeline for building machine learning surrogates for Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies and forces, integrating uncertainty quantification (UQ), misspecification detection, and quantum computing. The project leverages open datasets, ensemble ML models, and quantum algorithms to advance materials modeling and reliability.

## Folder Structure
- `scripts/` — Python scripts for data processing, model training, benchmarking, quantum demos, and visualization
- `models/` — Saved ML models and checkpoints
- `data/` — Raw and processed datasets
- `results/` — Generated figures, plots, and tables
- `doc/` — Project documentation, implementation plan, literature review, and academic paper (LaTeX)

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd camp
   ```
2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run scripts**
   - Data download and preprocessing: `python scripts/download_preprocess_mp.py`
   - Model training: `python scripts/train_surrogate.py`
   - UQ and benchmarking: `python scripts/train_surrogate_with_uq.py`, `python scripts/evaluate_benchmark.py`
   - Quantum demos: `python scripts/quantum_angle_demo.py`

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib
- qiskit, qiskit-aer

Install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Documentation
- See `doc/project_documentation.md` for implementation details, dataset summary, and literature review.
- See `doc/paper_draft.tex` for the academic paper (compile with `pdflatex`).

## Reproducibility
All code, data, and results are provided for academic use. Figures and tables are generated by scripts and saved in `results/`.
