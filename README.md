## Research Methodology

### Quantum Framework Components

#### 1. Quantum State Preparation

```latex
|\psi_i⟩ = Σⱼ αᵢⱼ |fⱼ⟩
```

Materials encoded as quantum states in Hilbert space spanned by normalized features.

#### 2. Multi-Observable Uncertainty

```latex
σ²(Ôₖ) = ⟨ψ|Ôₖ²|ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ|Ôₖ|ψ⟩²
```

Quantum variance across structural, electronic, and thermodynamic observables.

#### 3. Selection Strategy

```latex
U_total = √(Σₖ |αₖ|² σ²(Ôₖ) + Σₖ≠ₗ αₖ* αₗ Cov(Ôₖ, Ôₗ))
```

Quantum superposition-based uncertainty combining multiple observables.
