# Models Folder

This folder contains saved machine learning models and checkpoints generated during training. Models are produced by scripts in the `scripts/` directory and can be loaded for evaluation or further training.

- Random Forest, Deep Ensemble, GPR, Neural Network models
- Checkpoints and serialized model files (e.g., .joblib, .pkl)

To retrain or update models, rerun the training scripts.
